I published the design of our ERP system and added features such as Human Resources and Financial Reports to match the needs of our project. My partner, John, is making the design functional by coding it and using the same layout and color scheme I created. As the designer, I focused on the user interface and overall look, while John worked on development and system functionality. I also assist him by giving updates on what features were added so he can implement them properly. We collaborate closely to make sure our work is aligned and the system is complete.
